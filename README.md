# Comparing-Mamba-and-Transformer-on-Text-Classification
This is my college project demonstration.  
We mainly focus on how the Mamba architecture work.
We compare Mamba and Transformer by two different text classification dataset.
And the cmoparisons include the accuracy and the resouce (GPU usage , training time , inderence time ...)
